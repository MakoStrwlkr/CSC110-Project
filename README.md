# CSC110-Project

List of potential questions (that need to be revised ofc)
- The relationship between the actual climate and the news frequency about climate change
- The effects of agronomy on worsening climate change
- Analyzing the effect(s) of discourse on agricultural reforms, social determinants of health and hunger (on short-term varying basis), and development of agricultural land, on a country's environment performance index.
- Using Amazon forest fire's data and the local climate in the past year at Amazon to calculate the relationship between tree growth, fire, and climate change (might not work since climate refers to more than one year, but we may also do the forest fire over the past years)
- Emission of greenhouse gas from Asian festivals and how much they contribute to climate change compared to the total (in chinese culture, ppl burn papers when other ppl die as a way to send money to heaven, chinese and middle easterns light joss stick to worship god(s), and there's a fire festival in japan where set up huge bonfire pits for an entire night)
